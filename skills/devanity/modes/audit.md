# audit

Load: `reference/vocabulary.md`, `reference/quality.md`, `reference/baseline.md`, `reference/claude-code.md`; `reference/adjudication.md` for the fresh-context pass; `reference/rules.schema.json` for the map proposal.

A bounded health review of the working tree in scope: tracked and untracked files, gitignored ones excluded. Read-only: nothing outlives the reply unless the user asks for a record. The words after `audit` are the scope (paths, a package, a domain); with none, ask. `audit instructions [path]` scopes it to the instruction surfaces (`reference/baseline.md`, Deep) beneath the path, or to every one.

## Size first

Probe NUL-safe, over tracked and untracked files alike:

```txt
{ git ls-files -z <scope…>; git ls-files -z --others --exclude-standard <scope…>; } | tr '\0' '\n' | grep -c .   # files
{ git ls-files -z <scope…> <excl…>; git ls-files -z --others --exclude-standard <scope…> <excl…>; } | xargs -0 cat | wc -l   # lines, one total
```

`<scope…>` is one pathspec argument per path, never one quoted string. Binary and generated files (lockfiles, build output, vendored, snapshots, `linguist-generated` in `.gitattributes`) are listed with that reason, never swept, and kept out of every line count: `<excl…>` is one `':(exclude)<glob>'` per such path.

The contract is exhaustive: every file read, every syndrome applied, every dimension scored with a cited check. Past about 100 files or 30k lines it degrades silently. Then propose 2–4 sub-scopes along seams (package, layer, domain) as a `scope` decision (a menu when interactive, `reference/claude-code.md`), and audit the one chosen. Narrowing hides what lives between sub-scopes, such as duplication across them and cycles between them. So still run any repository-wide mechanical check at full width, and list the cross-scope checks you did not run under Coverage. An instruction scope past about 15 surfaces batches the same way: every surface inventoried, the unread ones `pending (batch k)`, the options bounded `audit instructions <directory>` batches under the manifest rule (`reference/baseline.md`); the run that finishes the last batch owes the verdict.

## Instruction surfaces

A surface is one file; for JSDoc/TSDoc, one file's doc blocks, whose claims tag `co-located-spec`, never `instruction-hygiene`. A surface finding anchors as `path:heading:dimension:rule`.

- Name the ambiguity or failure each surface should reduce and the smallest correct surface on the ladder (`reference/quality.md`); prefer enforceable structure to prose, and keep the surface in basis-form. Stale or duplicated text is a finding whose fix removes it; each asserted behavior is verified, or the test that would verify it is named.
- A rule in force with no durable home is a finding whose fix writes that home.
- A named target absent from disk → `absent`, and stop. An unreadable one is `absent (unreadable: <reason>)`.
- No surfaces at all does not end the run: each rule in force with no agent-legible home and no enforcement is a finding. The absence bounds the syndromes, never reconciliation or severity.
- `### Surfaces found / reviewed` lists every surface the Deep baseline discovers as `reviewed` (enforced or prose-only, context cost LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH) or `absent`. One missing from the list is a defect of the run; the verdict is owed only when every one is dispositioned.
- A fix inside one surface runs as `/devanity improve <path>`, and so does one that writes a missing home: its `fix:` names the new file's path, which its Key carries. One that edits a second file runs as `/devanity improve <Key>`.

## Steps

1. Run the Deep baseline and disposition every item.
2. Apply to every file in scope its syndrome set: the crosswalk checks for code, and the instruction syndromes for instruction surfaces, skill files included (`reference/quality.md`).
3. Give every dimension in `reference/quality.md` a status, one row each, derived from this run's open findings and never judged apart from them:
   - examined with a cited check → `GOOD` (no open finding) · `WEAK` (only P2/P3) · `BAD` (a P0/P1 is open; if accepted, `BAD — accepted risk`, never upgraded);
   - `NOT_RELEVANT` → the scope holds no artifact the dimension governs; cite why;
   - `UNKNOWN` → relevant and addressed, but the evidence is insufficient or unsafe to obtain; cite why. No cited check → `UNKNOWN`, never `GOOD`. An open P0/P1 wins over `UNKNOWN`.
   - A relevant dimension skipped for capacity is not dispositioned: end with `### Verdict none — audit completion pending` and propose a narrower scope.
4. Roll the statuses up into the Foundations (`reference/quality.md`). For Observability and Reversibility, say what the scope has (a runtime signal tied to a property; rollback, flags, reversible migrations) or lacks, with evidence.
5. Reconcile declared against enforced rules, and check that boundaries are enforced.
6. Rank the hotspots (below) and order the findings by them.
7. List the findings, a decision for each owed stop, and a safe sequence. `AUDIT_BACKLOG` is the only terminal verdict, whatever the finding count.
8. Propose the map entries and the ratchets (below).

## Hotspots

Change frequency, from `git log` alone:

```txt
git log -n 300 --no-merges --format= --name-only -- <scope…> | grep . | grep -Fxf <(git ls-files) | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

The window is the last 300 commits from HEAD, never a date relative to today, so the same HEAD ranks the same; paths that no longer exist drop out. Fewer commits than the window → the ranking covers the whole history; say so. Priority is frequency × complexity (the ratchet's metric when one runs, else line count, generated files excluded). A shallow clone (`git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository`) makes frequency `UNKNOWN`; never extrapolate.

## Map proposal

Draft or amend `devanity.rules.json` (`reference/rules.schema.json`): one entry per path whose rule differs from the defaults, each field with its evidence.

- `tier`: set by directory (`src/billing/**`); a file glob only for an exception inside one. `high-risk` where a change alters a guarded contract (the membership test of `reference/quality.md`, Severity), never every file of a high-risk domain: its docs and fixtures take their own tier. `trivial` for docs and generated output, never for an instruction surface (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/**`, skill, mode and agent files), which is `normal` at least.
- `check`: a command the repository already runs (CI, package scripts), never invented, and one the CI job can run on its runner: one that needs a service the job does not provide (a database, docker) is replaced by the narrower command that runs without it, or by none. Every high-risk path, and every path with no check that could fail for it, gets one, or a report line saying none exists and why (the schema has no field for it): the Stop oracle runs only the declared check.
- `purpose`: one line, what the path is, in the repository's own words (a README, an ADR).
- `invariants`: what never changes there, each from a test, an ADR, a rule in force or a finding; none found → omit it, never guess.
- `core: true`: only for a path the repository's own evidence names as the stable center (an ADR, or the module the others depend on whose invariants tests pin), never by taste, and orthogonal to `tier`. A `core` invariant with no check that fails when it breaks is a finding: promote it from prose to a test the path's `check` runs.
- `verifiers` (top level): the files the declared checks read (`package.json` for `npm test`, `pytest.ini`, `jest.config.*`, a root `conftest.py`), so the CI job treats weakening one next to code as a verifier change.
- Owners stay in `CODEOWNERS`, never in the map. `tests` globs only when the naming differs from the defaults.
- Each glob matches a tracked file under the loader's glob semantics, which a `git ls-files` pathspec does not share: once the file is on disk, `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/devanity-rules-ci.mjs" --self-check` (one parent commit needed) refuses a dead path, as the CI job does. Until then the match is `NOT_RUN`.

Show the whole file. The guards read it, so writing it is a hook-affecting change: this run never writes it.

## Ratchets

A ratchet freezes the legacy in a baseline and fails only what gets worse. Propose one, as a finding, for each class a gate can decide that recurs or sits in a top hotspot:

- **Tool:** one the repository already runs first; otherwise the stack's standard (Foundations, `reference/quality.md`). It is the repository's dependency, proposed for its PR; devanity never adds one.
- **Threshold:** measured, never a default. Run the metric over the scope, cite the distribution (median, p90, max), and set the limit where only genuine outliers report. Today's outliers go into the baseline, never into a looser limit. A flat distribution with no outliers → the limit is today's max, and the baseline is empty.
- **Where it fires:** a CI step, or the map's `check`. A new dependency or a CI change is a trade: propose and stop.

## Example

Scope `src/payments`.

```md
### Verdict AUDIT_BACKLOG

### Scope audited
src/payments (probe: 14 files, 2.1k lines)

### Coverage
Read 14/14 files; checks: per-file syndrome sweep, tsc config resolved, CI workflow read, claim diff CLAUDE.md vs scripts. Not checked: runtime behavior of the totals path (no test covers it: G-001).

### Baseline
Enforced: strict TS (tsconfig), lint and unit tests (CI test job). Prose-only: "always use money integers" (CLAUDE.md). Absent: pre-commit hooks, coverage gate, devanity.rules.json. Instruction surfaces: root CLAUDE.md only.

### Dimension status
| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| compressibility | GOOD | per-file sweep: largest file 210 lines, no cross-layer logic |
| executable-spec | BAD | "money integers" rule prose-only: open P1 G-002 |
| co-located-spec | GOOD | totals.spec.md present, states non-goals |
| verification-loop | BAD | focused check: none for the totals path: open P0 G-001 |
| boundary-integrity | GOOD | import sweep: payments never imported outside its package |
| pattern-hygiene | WEAK | syndrome sweep 14/14: no copied workaround; complexity unbounded: open P2 G-005 |
| debt-containment | GOOD | 1 TODO, visible and linked to an issue |
| instruction-hygiene | GOOD | syndrome pass on CLAUDE.md: no hits |

### Foundations
Executable Intent BAD · Testability BAD · Understandability WEAK · Deterministic Guardrails GOOD · Observability absent: nothing signals a totals mismatch (inside G-001) · Reversibility present: totals are computed on read, never stored.

### Hotspots
`src/payments/totals.ts` 23 commits × 210 lines · `src/payments/refunds.ts` 9 × 140 · the rest ≤ 3 commits. G-001 sits in the top hotspot.

### Required fixes
- **[P0][dominant][G-001][verification-loop][enforcement] Float arithmetic on money in `sumLineItems`**
  - fix: integer cents, plus a test in the suite CI already runs  ·  src/payments/totals.ts:31
  - Key: src/payments/totals.ts:sumLineItems:verification-loop:float-money
  - why: `10.10+20.20+30.30 !== 60.6` and no test covers it: billing drift.
  - basis: checked: the failing case becomes the test; no API change; one deterministic case in a suite CI already runs (de minimis, named).
- **[P1][trade][G-002][executable-spec][enforcement] "money integers" rule unenforced**
  - fix: a lint rule banning float literals in `src/payments/**`, wired into CI  ·  CLAUDE.md:31
  - Key: CLAUDE.md:money-rule:executable-spec:prose-only
  - why: CLAUDE.md states the rule and nothing fails when it is broken; G-001 is that break, shipped.
  - basis: trade: no installed rule decides it, so it needs a plugin, cost unpriced; whether the rule is durable intent is G-004.

### Suggested improvements
none

### Decisions
- **[DECIDE][blocking][G-003][acceptance] Authorize a write to the money path to fix G-001?**
  - decision: whether the billing sum may change; an authorization this run does not hold (kernel rung 4).
  - context: anchors G-001; `sumLineItems` is a billing path.
  - options: authorize → `/devanity improve G-001` proposes the patch and stops for this answer · decline → G-001 stays open · test only → land the failing case as a test and re-decide.
  - recommendation: authorize; a known failing case, and the fix is smaller than the exposure.
  - if undecided: the P0 stays unaccepted and re-fires on the next audit.
- **[DECIDE][blocking][G-004][rule] Is "money integers" a contract worth a gate?**
  - decision: whether the rule is durable intent (enforce it) or a stale preference (demote it); product intent.
  - context: anchors G-002.
  - options: enforce → `/devanity improve G-002` · demote → rewrite the line as guidance, close G-002 · defer → dormant, worth doing when the next money bug lands.
  - recommendation: enforce, after G-001.
  - if undecided: proposed for tracker promotion as an open decision; re-surfaces on the next audit.

### Suggested sequence
G-001 once G-003 authorizes it; then G-002 per G-004.

### Do-not-touch without approval
Anything altering the billing path, `sumLineItems` included (G-003).

### Map proposal
`{ "version": 1, "paths": { "src/payments/**": { "tier": "high-risk", "check": "pnpm test --filter payments", "purpose": "order totals, refunds and payment capture", "invariants": ["money is integer cents"] } } }`
Evidence: tier, G-001 (billing arithmetic); check, the command the CI test job runs; purpose, src/payments/README.md:1; invariant, CLAUDE.md:31, pending G-004; glob match NOT_RUN until the file is written (self-check).

### Ratchets
- **[P2][trade][G-005][pattern-hygiene][enforcement] Function complexity unbounded in `src/payments`**
  - fix: ESLint `complexity: ["error", 12]` in the existing eslint.config.js, today's two offenders in ESLint bulk suppressions, run by the CI lint job  ·  eslint.config.js:1
  - Key: eslint.config.js:complexity:pattern-hygiene:complexity-ratchet
  - why: over 61 functions, median 3, p90 8, max 19; a limit of 12 reports only `sumLineItems` and `applyRefund`, both in the top hotspots.
  - basis: trade: the rule joins an existing config, but the suppressions file is a new config surface.

### First safe improvement
`/devanity improve G-001`: high-risk class, so it proposes the patch and stops at G-003.
```

## Example: instruction scope

`audit instructions` in a repository with a 412-line root `CLAUDE.md`, no `AGENTS.md`, and a README that says the team also works in Codex.

```md
### Verdict AUDIT_BACKLOG

### Scope audited
instruction surfaces, whole repository (Deep inventory: 1 on disk)

### Surfaces found / reviewed
- `CLAUDE.md` — reviewed: prose-only, 412 lines, context cost HIGH
- `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/rules/**`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursorrules`, skill files — absent

### Coverage
Read CLAUDE.md 412/412; checks: the instruction syndromes, claim diff CLAUDE.md vs package.json scripts and ci.yml. Not checked: nothing in scope.

### Baseline
Enforced: lint and tests (CI). Prose-only: every rule in CLAUDE.md. Absent: AGENTS.md, pre-commit hooks, devanity.rules.json.

### Dimension status
| Dimension | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| compressibility | NOT_RELEVANT | no code in an instruction scope |
| executable-spec | NOT_RELEVANT | no code in an instruction scope |
| co-located-spec | NOT_RELEVANT | no `*.spec.md` or doc blocks among the surfaces |
| verification-loop | NOT_RELEVANT | no code in an instruction scope |
| boundary-integrity | NOT_RELEVANT | no code in an instruction scope |
| pattern-hygiene | NOT_RELEVANT | no code in an instruction scope |
| debt-containment | NOT_RELEVANT | no code in an instruction scope |
| instruction-hygiene | BAD | open P1 G-001, G-002 |

### Foundations
Understandability BAD · every other Foundation NOT_RELEVANT: the scope holds no artifact it governs.

### Hotspots
`CLAUDE.md` 31 commits × 412 lines.

### Required fixes
- **[P1][dominant][G-001][instruction-hygiene][prose] `CLAUDE.md` grown into a manual, with a stale command**
  - fix: cut it to what only Claude needs, each removed block replaced by a pointer to its home  ·  CLAUDE.md:88
  - Key: CLAUDE.md:Testing:instruction-hygiene:manual-growth
  - why: claim diff: CLAUDE.md:88 runs `npm run test:unit`, which package.json does not define; lines 210–370 repeat README.md's setup. 412 lines against the 200-line bound.
  - basis: checked: every removed block has a home (README.md, or AGENTS.md after G-002); one file; no rule dropped.
- **[P1][dominant][G-002][instruction-hygiene][prose] No home Codex reads for the rules in force**
  - fix: create `AGENTS.md` holding the four cross-tool rules of CLAUDE.md:12–30  ·  AGENTS.md (new)
  - Key: AGENTS.md:(new):instruction-hygiene:missing-home
  - why: README.md:5 names Codex, which reads AGENTS.md and never CLAUDE.md: its sessions run with none of the rules.
  - basis: checked: one new file whose content exists; propagation, not an empty axis (`reference/quality.md`, Basis-form).

### Suggested improvements
none

### Suggested sequence
G-002, then G-001 (its pointers target the new AGENTS.md).

### Do-not-touch without approval
none

### Map proposal
none — no surface's rule differs from the defaults

### Ratchets
none — no gate in this stack decides instruction bloat

### First safe improvement
`/devanity improve AGENTS.md`: creates the missing home G-002 names.
```
